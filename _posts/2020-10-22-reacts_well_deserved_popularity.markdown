React is basically a JavaScript library which enables users to easily build responsive user interfaces for web applications. It was developed by Facebook develops and canbe used for both online single page applications or mobile applications. One of the many attractive features of React is that it can can maintain state and render a change in the data without reloading the entire page. It adequately meets its goals of being fast, scalable, and simple. I too have come to appreciate React after completing the React module at Flat Iron school and creating a React application. 

React makes a developer's life easy by giving us a virtual DOM. As developers, we know that working with the DOM can be difficult, we have to deal with cross browser inconsistencies, various methods to access certain nodes, and the fact that much of the DOM is not standardized. This is where React comes in and provides the developer with a friendlier DOM which acts like surrogate for the actual browser. 

React has no barriers to entry, any JavaScript developer or JavaScript student can easily learn React. If your JavaScript skills are adequate, you can learn React in a few hours. Those JSX functions enable a developer to create rich, interactive applications declaritively. Those functions are referred to as Components which at their core are just JavaScript functions. This is also where 'Separation of Concerns' of a React app comes in to play. 

React enables developers write code that is simple to maintain and modular. It is best practice in React to have each component to carry out just one task, this is what is meant by *Separation of Concern*. Each component is independent and interchangeable, which means that developers can reuse these components instead of writing code again. It also keeps the code cohesive and manageable. Developers are known for being lazy and reusable components are another important factor in React's popularity.
