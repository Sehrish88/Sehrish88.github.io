Ever since starting my journey of becoming a full stack software developer, I had tried my best to grasp the concepts of programming and thinking in terms of softtware, programming syntax and the very important concept of object orientation. The Sinatra and Rails frameworks really helped me get comfortable with writing Ruby and I was getting enough confidence to want to build more independent projects using the knowkedge I had gained thus far. After submitting my rails project, and passing my assesment, I was excited to get started with JavaScript because I thought I'd have an easy time grasping it since I was alrady familiar with one programming language. 

However, this wasn't entirely the case. Although both Ruby and JavaScript are object oriented languages, and utilize loops, arrays and methods, I found JavaScript tougher to grasp. Writing Ruby is very easy and it mimicks conversational english, but I found the syntax of JavaScript superfluous and confusing because of the use of parenthesis () and curly braces {}. Also added on to the weighty task of learning the syntax of a new programming language was the usage of call back functions in a function and the ability to call one function in another function! This was something I had not seen or done with Ruby. 

I feel like the lessons on learn-co weren't enough to properly grasp JS. Many times, i found myself searching the internet for videos and tutorials for better explanations on arrow functions, async and await, DOM manipulation,  built in functions and ES6 modules. I was able to grasp enough in order to build out a functional JS with Rails API project, and I know that I will have to keep on working on JS in order to be able to work with React which the upcoming project will require.
