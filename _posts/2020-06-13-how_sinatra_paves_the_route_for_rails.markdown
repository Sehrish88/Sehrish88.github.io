I just finished writing the code for my Rails portfolio project, and it wasn't all doom and gloom or confusion. I had a greater appreciation and understanding for rails due to the fact that Flat Iron School had us create an application in the Sinatra Framework before we tackled the heavy duty Ruby on Rails Framework. I now realize this was done to give us an indepth knowledge of routes, URLs, and associations between models. 

With my Sinatra Project, I had to render and redirect by typing in the URL path that I wanted the user to navigate to. With Rails this was much easier through the use of URL helpers and the instance variables we defined in our controllers. As a programmer, you can type 'rails routes' in to your terminal and be presented with a long list of pre-defined routes you can use to display various views specific to your models and the resources you've defined in your config/routes.rb file, rails is truly magical, but one wouldn't be able to fully appreciate this magic if they did not experience Sinatra first. 

Both Sinatra and Rail use rack which is a modular interface between web servers and web applications written in the Ruby language. Sinatra is fast paced and defines almost nothing for you, whereas Rails is powerful and each piece of code is defined and precise so it makes it easy to develop complicated web apps in a limited amount of time. With Sinatra you have got to come up with your own structure whereas Rails defines everything and provides the structure of your web application for you. 

Sintra will teach you the basics of HTTP and routing and Rails will teach you about your resources and how to store and retrieve related information from your database based on the associations of your models which you have defined. When learned consecutively, Sinatra and Rails give you a comprehensive knowledge of HTTP, routes, resources, databases, and how to associate models to be able to design dynamic and functional web applications.
