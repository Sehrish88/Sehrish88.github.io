After immersing myself in coding, and more specifically the Ruby language, I quickly learned about it's data structures like arrays and hashes. Different data structures are useful for different tasks. Arrays are one of the first types of data structure which we learn about and they can be used to store contiguous data, which is data that comes one after the other without any breaks. Arrays are usually returned when we gather results from running a loop. Arrays also have many of their own methods and we can iterate through arrays to give us specific data that we want. This is exactly what I did in my CLI ten_day_weather_forecast app; I iterated through a big array of weather forecast attributes to pick and extract the specific weather attributes that I wanted to display to the user in my app. 

Data structures like hashes use key and value pairs to store data. Every key has a value, and the value can be a string, integer, or symbol. In my CLI application I used a weather forecast API which returned a huge hash of weather properties. Every weather property like high-temp, low-temp, snow, precipitation etc had a specific value which was based on the city and state entered by the user. The weather hash also included arrays of different weather properties, and I had to iterate through the hash to extract the patient properties that I wanted. 

Data structures can be seen as a metaphor for life because life is all about data and information, and us trying to classify or extract that data and information. Data structures would be useful in any field which humans have ventured in such as the health field in which patients can be mapped to physicians, or contact information where names can be mapped to phone numbers, or even dictionaries where words can be mapped to definitions. Data structures can prove useful to any field that uses data and as we know, data is everywhere.
